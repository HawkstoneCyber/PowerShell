#   PowerShell

I've been creating these fit for purpose scripts built on PowerShell 7 over the last year. I'll be adding more as I review and finalize them.

| **Script**  | **Function** |
| :--- | :--- |
| [PS-Selenium.ps1](https://github.com/HawkstoneCyber/PowerShell/tree/main/scripts/PS-Selenium.ps1)  | Proof of concept automated website login and status update using Selenium WebDriver  |
| [PS-CVESearch.ps1](https://github.com/HawkstoneCyber/PowerShell/tree/main/scripts/PS-CVESearch.ps1) | MITRE CVE search by keyword  |
| [Get-OutlookEmailHeaderBrief.ps1](https://github.com/HawkstoneCyber/PowerShell/tree/main/scripts/Get-OutlookEmailHeaderBrief.ps1) | Outlook Email Header Extraction (Brief)  |
